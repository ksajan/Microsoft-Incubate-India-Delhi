Current Method of Routing algorithms does not consider the safety of the route to be followed.
Rapidly changing data makes decision making and crime prediction difficult.
Intelligence led policing lacks precision and hence is inefficient with regard to resource management.

Digital Crime Maps linked with a  realtime Database can enhance  the routing policy by  providing comprehensive analysis  of crime patterns using Machine Learning. 
<br>
<br>
Predictive Policing Application that would churn the recorded crime data and relevant risk factors to to find the safest path for travel along with considering shortest time and convenient ride. 
<br>
<br>
Incidents like  eve teasing, encroachment etc  can be reported to a crime map  accessible to the general public  and the police which will update the real time database.
