Proposed Solution :

An Android App consisting of many features to control the increasing crime rates.
First Feature we are providing is a Secured Hashed Algorithm Backed QR Code(SHATag)
which will work by scanning the SHATag while someone is boarding the public vehicle, 
SHATag is secured mechanism to be provided by Govt. on verification of Drivers and 
Cabs, Buses and other public Vehicles. Scanning the QR Code, will enable the user to 
verify the service provider.
After Scanning Code, Realtime Location of the Vehicle will be shared with the Concerned 
family and  authorities.
Secondly, we are providing some in built feature of app, that allows user on the way 
go create an emergency alarm, to the userâ€™s relatives and authorities.
Another proposed solution is we can share audio input of the incident via app.

1. Register Page

5. Send Live Location
