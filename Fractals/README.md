# Project Title

goSaferRoads - Improving Road Management

## Theme Choosen

MapMyIndiaApi

## Project Description

According to the research done by CSIR - CRRI around 1000 crore
amount of fuel and maintenance cost gets wasted in India due to damaged
roads. Also the government requires an extensive study to check whether
the roads are damaged or not and this will require a lot of time. Third
problem, we focussed is the knowledge of AQI levels for each road so that
we can take the road which is less polluted.
We focussed on these three problems and made a solution which will
detect the AQI levels outside the car and also the damaged road condition
and will send these data along with the GPS coordinates to the cloud.
Government can easily take the data from the cloud to check where the
road is damaged. Also we can integrate this data along with MapMyIndia 
and add a weight to AQI Level and Road Condition to get another optimised path for the destination. This will lessen pollution and also have less damaged roads.
